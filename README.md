# Space Invaders / Galaga Clone using Space Shooter Redux

I'm just messing around with Kenny's Space Shooter Redux files. You can get the
official set of files from [Open Game Art](http://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux).

[Lume](https://github.com/rxi/lume/), [Middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass),
[Lovebird](https://github.com/rxi/lovebird) and [Lurker](https://github.com/rxi/lurker)
are all Lua libraries found through [Awesome LÃ¶ve2D](https://github.com/love2d-community/awesome-love2d).
